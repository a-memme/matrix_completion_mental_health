# Low-rank approximation in mental health self-report measures
*Exploring the suitability of low-rank approximation vs leading imputation methods for predicting missing data in self-report mental health measures. Downstream effects of imputed datasets are also explored and analytical approaches discussed.*

## Overview
### Purpose 
Quite a large body of research has explored the statistical process of imputation within the domain of medical diagnostics - specifically Electronic Health Records (EHR) that are susceptible to data sparseness - however, quite a small body of research has synonymously investigated these approaches for the more qualitative, yet comparably critical field of mental health. Given ongoing advancements in technology, mental health awareness, and general resources, we have become increasingly better positioned to collect longitudinal, self-report mental health records and information at scale, however, at the risk of potential sparseness (Wu et al, 2022). Uncovering or exploring effective approaches at imputing these datasets reliabily could thus provide a notable contribution to the framework of diagnosis and longitudinal study in modern mental-health diagnostics research and practice. 

Given the above, the current project aims at exploring the suitability of low-rank approximantion as a method of imputation in sparse mental health records, specifically in comparison to popular
imputation techniques that rely more heavily on local patterns rather than a datasetâ€™s global
structure. The intuition here is to explore whether the success found in applying matrix completion to traditional medical diagnostics can be (somewhat) replicated in the domain of mental health, where the data in question is much more susceptible to random variability due to its inherent self-report and highly qualitative nature.

### Data
Three different forms of mental health datasets are leveraged in this analysis to cover an understanding of generalizability. For the purposes of time and , only **Student Dataset** is used to explore in-depth analytics, but all resources are considered for overall implications of study.
